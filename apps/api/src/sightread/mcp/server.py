"""The MCP endpoint: streamable HTTP at `POST /mcp`, mounted in the same app (docs/mcp.md).

A shell and nothing more. The one tool mints a single-use upload ticket (docs/auth.md § 5)
and formats the `curl` commands that carry it; the document bytes go out-of-band through
`/v1/parse`, because base64 in tool arguments would burn the file size over again in model
tokens. No parsing decision, no model choice and no queue knowledge lives here, so an MCP
spec change touches this file alone (docs/project-structure.md § Boundaries).
