# Testing

## Cost safety — user OpenRouter keys are real money

- Tests **never** call OpenRouter or any live LLM. All upstream HTTP is stubbed (`respx` over httpx). CI must pass with no network.
- A live smoke test requires the operator's explicit per-instance approval: one tiny document, one cheap model, never a loop or sweep.

## Backend (`apps/api`)

- `uv run pytest`. pytest + pytest-asyncio; DB tests against a throwaway Postgres (compose `pg` or testcontainers), each test in a rolled-back transaction where possible.
- Fixture documents in `tests/fixtures/`: a small text-layer PDF, a scanned-style PDF (rendered-only), a multi-page mix, one corrupt file, tiny jpg/png/webp/heic images. Generate or vendor tiny files — keep fixtures under a few hundred KB each.
- Poppler is a real dependency of the test environment (CI image installs `poppler-utils`); subprocess wrappers are tested against real fixtures, not mocked.
- Must-cover: routing heuristic (text_layer vs vision), bbox placeholder emission, dedup key matching + `force`, per-user job cap 429, SKIP LOCKED claim under two concurrent workers, source-file deletion at terminal state, sweeper, key encryption round-trip + masking, OAuth AS happy path (DCR → PKCE → token → `/mcp` auth), 402/429 upstream handling, MCP tools end to end through the official SDK client over ASGI (the app lifespan does not run under `ASGITransport`, so `/mcp` tests start the SDK session manager themselves).

## Frontend (`apps/web`)

- `pnpm test` (vitest) for composables/utils; `pnpm typecheck` and lint are part of done-criteria. No browser-automation UI verification — correctness is judged by reading code and types.

## Lint/format

- Python: `uv run ruff check` + `ruff format --check`. TypeScript: eslint + prettier per Nuxt defaults.
